_Contracts have mystical power. Break my contract and I’ll use your bones for my next quill._

— Documancer’s warning

Role held by: [[D&D/Faerun/Acquisitions Incorporated/Lore Reference/PCs/Seven\|Seven]]

Every great Acquisitions Incorporated quest begins with a contract from Head Office — and a franchise’s documancer is most likely the one who controls and channels the power of that contract. A documancer bears the responsibility of managing each of a franchise’s quests, of ensuring that every condition of the quest is fulfilled, and of recording and sending on information vital to Head Office when the mission is complete. When creating contracts with other organizations, a documancer makes sure that the language benefits both the franchise and Acquisitions Incorporated.

As a documancer, you are respected for having the commitment and mental fortitude required to work with Head Office. You advance your franchise by using documancy for communication, insisting on recording all deals in writing, retaining records, destroying other records, and recalling vital information.

> Not everyone truly appreciates the art of documancy, and only the best and brightest are chosen for this most important work. Come to think of it, I’m not sure you make the cut.

Favorite Methods to Destroy Documents

|d6|Method|
|---|---|
|1|Any way you like, provided you make a copy first|
|2|Mimic shredder|
|3|Fake dragon-head incinerator|
|4|The bottomless hole in the basement — at least you’re pretty sure it’s bottomless|
|5|Feeding it to the goat out back|
|6|Making your coworkers eat it by slipping it into their food, piece by piece — it’s the only way to be sure|

> When other children borrowed her toys, Brynshal kept unnervingly robust records — duration, wear, remittance in case of loss, that kind of thing. In time, this hunger to define and make official the rhythm of daily life found its expression in documancy, a kind of mystic bureaucratic art founded by Omin Dran. Anything you put a signature to has power. And Brynshal wields that power with ease.

At rank 2, your [documancy satchel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703626-documancy-satchel) becomes a common magic item, allowing you to magically send and receive documents to and from Head Office through a special pouch. Your [documancy satchel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703626-documancy-satchel) magically produces prewritten and signature-ready contracts at your request, covering most common contractual needs. It also occasionally produces sticky notes printed with useful information and inspirational quotes from Head Office.

Also at rank 2, your documancer training allows you to better process Head Office communications, as well as to understand what pleases your superiors. You can cast the [augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2007-augury) spell, with the spell’s omens of weal or woe based solely on the perspective of Head Office. (It should be noted that Head Office at times has a surprisingly high disregard for potential woe to its employees.) Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until dawn seven days later.

Also at rank 4, you can use an action to request one [spell scroll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5418-spell-scroll) containing a spell of up to 3rd level from Head Office. If you succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check, the scroll instantly appears within your [documancy satchel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703626-documancy-satchel). Only you can use this scroll. The scroll vanishes when used, or ten minutes after it has been summoned. After a successful use, this property of the satchel can’t be used again until dawn seven days later. If you failed the check, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Why Be a Documancer?

|d8|Reason|
|---|---|
|1|You heard a rumor once that signing a contract with your off hand is technically nonbinding, and you’re desperate to see if it’s true. For reasons.|
|2|All businesses have their ups and downs, but there’s always money to be made from “processing fees.”|
|3|You have a habit of always being clear about what you’ve promised, but never saying when you’ll do it.|
|4|You love doing decorative scrollwork on documents, knowing that’s the best place to hide the fine print.|
|5|As a child, you learned to cross your fingers behind your back when making a promise. Now you yearn to make that legally binding.|
|6|Your habit of screaming, “No take backs!” after any group decision seemed to suggest your true calling.|
|7|You believe that language is an art, not a science. Who’s to say what is or isn’t a “real” word?|
|8|The smell of old parchment makes you giddy.|
