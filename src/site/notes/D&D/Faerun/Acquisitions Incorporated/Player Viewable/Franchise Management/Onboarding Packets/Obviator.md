_I adjust the odds and remove obstacles to create maximum convenience for our franchise._

— Obviator creed

Role held by: [[D&D/Faerun/Acquisitions Incorporated/Lore Reference/PCs/Soren\|Soren]]

Obstacles abound along the path to riches. A franchise’s mission success might require combating a rival organization’s disinformation attempts one day, then besting a castle’s defenses the next. The day after that, some poor sap named Bob might need to be disposed of. And no matter what the type of challenge that needs to be overcome, the franchise’s obviator determines the optimal way to shut down and destroy that challenge. (Nothing personal, Bob. It’s just business.)

As an obviator, you hatch convoluted plots to fight the overwhelming odds presented by each mission — by whatever means are necessary. Sometimes, you might prefer brute strength and improvisation. Other times, you might undertake a deep study of conflicts and rival organizations, working carefully to stay three steps ahead of the opposition. In all cases, though, you help advance your franchise by hatching effective plans and tactics, anticipating problems, and learning about your foes — ideally before they can treat you as an obstacle to their own success.

Noteworthy Obviators: Lok

Essential Functions: Destroy targets (people and information); study conflicts

Position Proficiency: In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can add your proficiency bonus to an ability check to make sense of an enemy’s tactics, discern a hidden threat, or intimidate a foe whose weaknesses you have previously assessed (see “Read the Opposition” below).

Head office also grants you the use of [alchemist’s supplies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/102-alchemists-supplies) (two glass beakers, a metal frame to hold a beaker in place over an open flame, a glass stirring rod, a small mortar and pestle, and a pouch of common alchemical ingredients including salt, powdered iron, and purified water); your choice of a [vial of acid](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/18-acid-vial), a [flask of alchemist’s fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/19-alchemists-fire-flask), or a [vial of antitoxin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/204-antitoxin); and a [hunting trap](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/52-hunting-trap).

Also at rank 1, you can attempt to get a reading on one creature you can see, trying to learn useful information about it. As a bonus action, make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. On a success, you learn three details of your choice about the creature. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature only once on any creature.

> Obviation is as much a philosophy as it is a practice. It’s not a good fit for those who want to remain … you know, fully alive.

Possible details you might learn include the creature’s goals or motivation, bonds or ideals, personality traits, flaws, combat strategy (including common attack methods or tactics), financial information, lair location, allies or foes, romantic entanglements, sense of humor, or favorite songs.

At rank 2, you can use an action to use your alchemist’s supplies to identify any unknown substance (including alchemical items, potions, and other magical substances). Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

Where You First Dabbled in Alchemy

|d8|Learning Experience|
|---|---|
|1|You traveled with a charlatan alchemist for years, until they were arrested for selling fake healing potions. You still remember how to get the taste just right.|
|2|You were once the head dishwasher in a famous wizard’s college.|
|3|One of your parents was a healer in a small outpost, and they taught you that even the most mundane flora and natural materials can be used to wondrous effect.|
|4|While lost in the Underdark, you were forced to consume mold, fungus, and insect parts to survive. You developed a taste for that sort of thing.|
|5|You think you might be addicted to holy water. You just can’t stop drinking it long enough to find out for sure.|
|6|You were once the personnel manager of a struggling business and needed to come up with a herbal cure-all that would keep employees awake for eighteen-hour shifts. No one died. Mostly.|
|7|As the child of a wealthy and despotic noble, you learned to smell [poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) pastries a mile off. A shame that your siblings weren’t so talented.|
|8|As a server in a tavern, you refined the perfect hangover cure but never wrote the recipe down. Now you’re desperate to recreate it.|

Also at rank 2, you gain the use of an uncommon magic item taking the form of a pair of spectacles, a spyglass, a monocle, or any other device with one or two lenses. When you look through the [obviator’s lenses](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/704032-obviators-lenses), you use a bonus action to make them function as [eyes of minute seeing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4634-eyes-of-minute-seeing) or [eyes of the eagle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4635-eyes-of-the-eagle). Once you make this choice, it cannot be changed until the next dawn.

> Like many Obviators, “Lok” chooses to use a working name rather than her actual name out of an abundance of caution. Obviators are cautious because they know precisely how dangerous any moment can be — and they are dangerous for the same reason. An obviator is like a lethal walking library. And if you were to face some kind of walking library at some point, Lok would know exactly what to do about it.

At rank 3, you gain the ability to declare that you’re totally prepared. This preparedness takes the from of asking yourself one question, then making a DC 15 Intelligence ([History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. On a success, you recall information you could have uncovered through earlier research about your mission. The information can be a discreet revelation, a vague hint, or even a riddle. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

_TRAVEL ALCHEMICAL KIT_

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ai/growing-your-franchise#TravelAlchemicalKit)Travel Alchemical Kit

Also at rank 3, Head Office provides you with a [travel alchemical kit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/704043-travel-alchemical-kit) — an uncommon magic item containing miniaturized versions of both [alchemist’s supplies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/102-alchemists-supplies) and a [poisoner’s kit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/125-poisoners-kit) (glass vials, a mortar and pestle, chemicals, and a glass stirring rod). You gain proficiency with a [poisoner’s kit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/125-poisoners-kit) as part of this upgrade.

You can use this magical kit as long as it is on your person, with no need to draw or stow it. If you are ever searched, finding your [travel alchemical kit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/704043-travel-alchemical-kit) requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) or Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check.

At rank 4, your [obviator’s lenses](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/704032-obviators-lenses) gain additional power and become a rare magic item. The lenses now function as both [eyes of the eagle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4635-eyes-of-the-eagle) and [eyes of minute seeing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4634-eyes-of-minute-seeing).

Additionally, you can focus the power of the lenses to gain accuracy in combat, gaining advantage on a weapon attack roll (no action required). If that attack hits, roll one additional weapon damage die. This property of the lenses can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Also at rank 4, when you use your Read the Opposition feature and fail the check, you still learn one detail about the target creature, as chosen by the DM. Additionally, you can use Read the Opposition more than once on the same creature, but if you do so, you cannot use that feature again on the same creature until you finish a long rest.

Why Be an Obviator?

|d8|Reason|
|---|---|
|1|There’s nothing that excites you more than a puzzle you can’t immediately solve.|
|2|Your favorite saying is, “All according to plan.” Especially when you have no idea what’s going on.|
|3|You have an entire room dedicated to notes and sketches connected by red yarn.|
|4|Your plans are so detailed that they have plans of their own.|
|5|You find the little details so much more interesting than … well, anything else.|
|6|You already had the chemical burns on your hands. Might as well make it official.|

|8|It’s not paranoia if they really are out to get you. And if you’re out to get them first.|
