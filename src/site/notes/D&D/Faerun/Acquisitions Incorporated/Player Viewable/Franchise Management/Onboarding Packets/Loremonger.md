_I never forget a detail … though many wish I would._

— Loremonger mantra

Role held by: [[D&D/Faerun/Acquisitions Incorporated/Lore Reference/PCs/Sierlox Pippenpaddleopsicopolis\|Sierlox Pippenpaddleopsicopolis]]

Information has value, and the loremonger is that information’s keeper. A franchise’s loremonger studies and records all lore relevant to its operation, including tracking the economic, technical, and arcane methods by which the franchise can be improved. A loremonger records the deeds and history of the franchise, including the names of places visited and people met during missions. Those records are then sent to Head Office (often through a franchise’s documancer) to ensure brand integrity.

As a loremonger, you are a studious individual, usually with an interest in history or technical subjects. You might revel in your role, working as a central figure in your franchise as you use your knowledge to promote it. Or you might operate from the shadows, resembling a clever spymaster and allowing others to be the franchise’s public face. You help advance your franchise by discovering secrets, tracking important lore gained during the characters’ travels, and reporting on competitors’ goals and methods.

Noteworthy Loremongers: Mabannok Kovri

Essential Functions: Record names, dates, and vital information

Position Proficiency: In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can add your proficiency bonus to an ability check to analyze the operation of a franchise, assess historical records, or decipher codes.

Also at rank 1, you are the beneficiary of a [whisper jar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703947-whisper-jar) — a common magic item resembling an ether-filled jar with a long tap hose. The jar is used to record others’ stories and your own observations, like a verbal notebook with unlimited space. The whisper jar records as fast as a creature can speak into it, and whispers back words at the same pace they were recorded. Activating the playback of a particular recording is an action.

Things Recorded in Your Whisper Jar

|d8|Recording|
|---|---|
|1|A live recording of the only performance of the mostly forgotten stage play Tabaxi on a Hot Tin Roof|
|2|The life’s work of the loremonger who owned the jar before you|
|3|Every courageous thought you’ve ever had, to cover for how scared you are most of the time|
|4|Everything, because everyone else around you will eat their words one day!|
|5|The top seven places to eat fried rat skewers in every settlement you’ve ever visited|
|6|The entire family tree of every royal line, extant or lost, in Faerûn|
|7|A moment-by-moment review of your favorite Jim Darkmagic stage performance|
|8|The sound of raucous applause, which you play back liberally|

At rank 2, your insight grants you preternatural knowledge of the creatures around you. As an action, select one humanoid you can see and make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. On a success, you learn the following information: the creature’s name, up to three aliases it has used within the past month, its primary profession, and its skill proficiencies. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. You can use this feature only once on any creature.

At rank 2, your [whisper jar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703947-whisper-jar) becomes an uncommon magic item that can tap into the broader lore of Acquisitions Incorporated. As a bonus action, you ask the jar for information on a specific subject and make a DC 15 Intelligence ([History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. On a success, the jar plays back a recording on that subject, made somewhere, sometime by another Acq Inc loremonger. This property of the [whisper jar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703947-whisper-jar) can’t be used again until the next dawn.

> Even without a whisper jar, Mabannok Kovri is an incomparable trove of lore. With the jar — that misty, transparent urn that all loremongers use as a tool of their station — they can scoot close to omniscience. “Mab” decants their whisper jar to share and protect any information vital to the franchise. But they have a particular sideline hobby of greedily trapping ribald dwarven poetry and recipes that “honor the noble turnip.”

At rank 3, your knowledge of best practices for improving an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise results in a 20 percent reduction in your franchise’s monthly costs (see “[Franchise Costs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ai/growing-your-franchise#FranchiseCosts "Franchise Costs")” earlier in this chapter, and “[Franchise Tasks and Downtime](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ai/growing-your-franchise#FranchiseTasksandDowntime "Franchise Tasks and Downtime")” later in this chapter).

Why Be a Loremonger?

| d8  | Reason                                                                                                                         |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Your favorite thing to hear is, “I probably shouldn’t say anything, but did you know … ?”                                      |
| 2   | Your whisper jar is a better conversationalist than most people you’ve ever met.                                               |
| 3   | You can’t keep a secret for the life of you, and you need to tell someone this thing you know or it’s going to kill you!       |
| 4   | You never know when someone else’s words will come in handy.                                                                   |
| 5   | Peoples and cultures can never die as long as their stories are still told.                                                    |
| 6   | You talked about a really cool idea once when you were drunk, and can’t remember a word of it now. That’ll never happen again. |
| 7   | A person is only as good as their word, and you feel compelled to keep others honest.                                          |
| 8   | You can’t read or write, so this whole recording-and-playing-back-what-you-say-in-a-jar thing is a huge benefit.               |
