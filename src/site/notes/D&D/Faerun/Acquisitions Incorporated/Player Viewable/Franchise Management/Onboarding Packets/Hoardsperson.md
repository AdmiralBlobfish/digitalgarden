_Disbursement of coin is at my discretion. Be really nice to me._

— Hoardsperson joke (not joking)

Role held by: [[D&D/Faerun/Acquisitions Incorporated/Lore Reference/PCs/Echo\|Echo]]

As the name suggests, Acquisitions Incorporated is all about the acquiring, and the hoardsperson’s job is all about storing that hard-earned loot. Each hoards­person plays the vital role of managing a franchise’s resources — including the inventory of all supplies used and treasure gained during an adventure. Hoards­persons pay particular attention to making sure that supplies are requisitioned through Acquisitions Incorporated-approved sources whenever possible, and ensuring that the proper selection of loot is sent to Head Office at the end of a mission.

As a hoards­person, you are known as a trustworthy and responsible individual. You support your franchise by demonstrating accuracy, avoiding shortfalls, and anticipating resource needs.

> Forever in search of “twinkles,” [Two Dry Cloaks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/360954-two-dry-cloaks) has a deep enthusiasm for treasure and a broad definition of what “treasure” might mean. As an old saying has it, “the hoard is the heart of a franchise,” and the tabaxi makes that case for her franchise every day. She believes that the contents of a hoard — as delivered to and from Head Office by way of the hoardsperson’s living loot satchel — are the most true, most dispassionate assessment of a team’s progress.

_LIVING LOOT SATCHEL_

The [living loot satchel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703697-living-loot-satchel) is a kind of magical being that safeguards the franchise’s funds and valuables. Its innards are connected to a secure coffer within Head Office’s vault in Waterdeep, to which the satchel periodically transfers the franchise’s wealth. As an action, you can transfer any amount of your franchise funds back to your satchel with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check.

Also at rank 2, Head Office trusts that as long as your needs are met, you have no reason to skim any profits. You maintain a wealthy lifestyle at no cost to you.

As a rank 3 hoards­person, your [living loot satchel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703697-living-loot-satchel) gets an upgrade to function as the replica chest used for the [Leomund’s secret chest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2346-leomunds-secret-chest) spell, becoming a rare magic item. You can open the secret chest through your [living loot satchel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703697-living-loot-satchel) to deposit or withdraw items — even items that wouldn’t normally fit in your satchel, but which fit within the chest. Thanks to Head Office striking deals you don’t want to know about with extraplanar creatures you really don’t want to know about, there is no chance for the spell to end.

At rank 3, you can use a bonus action to reach into your [living loot satchel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703697-living-loot-satchel) and make a DC 15 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. On a success, you draw forth an item of your choice on the [Adventuring Gear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment#AdventuringGear "Adventuring Gear") table in chapter 5 of the _[Player’s Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb "Player’s Handbook")_. The item must be of a size that can fit into your secret chest and be worth no more than 15 gp. Once you attempt to draw five items from your satchel, you cannot draw forth any more items until the next dawn.

At rank 4, your [living loot satchel](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703697-living-loot-satchel) receives another upgrade, becoming a very rare magic item. The secret chest accessed by your satchel now has the storage capacity of a [portable hole](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4699-portable-hole) — 6 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep. As before, you can place any appropriately sized object into the portable-hole-sized chest, even if it wouldn’t normally fit into your satchel.

> The key to the hoardsperson’s job is cataloging all goods that enter the party’s possession. You may also catalog goods that do not belong to the party. Sometimes it works.

Also at rank 4, when you use your That Thing You Need feature, you can requisition any item of up to 250 gp in value, as long as it would fit into the confines of your satchel’s [portable hole](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4699-portable-hole).

Why Be a Hoardsperson?

|d8|Reason|
|---|---|
|1|You once tried to dive into a huge pool of gold coins. It hurt.|
|2|You’ve been betrayed by your adventuring party before, and there’s no way now that you’ll trust anyone else to hold on to the loot|
|3|Once, through a series of increasingly complex negotiations, you traded a paper clip for temporary control of a minor fiefdom.|
|4|Material possessions don’t mean that much to you. Or at least that’s the story you’re going with.|
|5|You’ve never had a problem spending other people’s money. Surely keeping other people’s money can’t be that hard.|
|6|You believe there’s no such thing as worthless goods. Only unmotivated buyers.|
|7|You’re not a hoarder. More of a passionate collector. You can stop anytime you want. Really.|
|8|Given the personalities of the other party members, it was mutually agreed that you were the only one who could be trusted|
