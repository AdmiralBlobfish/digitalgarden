_I’m not saying there aren’t other perspectives. Just that my perspective is the only one that’s on-brand._

— Decisionist sales pitch

Role held by: [[D&D/Faerun/Acquisitions Incorporated/Lore Reference/PCs/Avelin Ayte\|Avelin Ayte]]

A decisionist brings decisive leadership to an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. They settle disputes and ensure that the team moves forward toward its goals, often serving as a leader (officially or otherwise) and compass for the party. A signature move of the decisionist is to impress the importance of a particular looming choice on the other franchisees, then call for a vote. The results of all franchise votes are recorded, then later reported to Head Office. Decisionists are also concerned with franchise morale and teamwork, helping all members of the franchise work together effectively.

All decisionists vary in their approach to the task. You might primarily attempt to convince others through charismatic arguments, or through force of will or intellectual cunning. You might lead by example, or by extolling the examples of other people who’ve done the things you haven’t quite gotten around to yet. Many decisionists go on to publish famous tomes, such as the best-selling Habits of Effective Adventuring Parties and I Don’t Care If the Rogue Stole Your Coins, We Have a Job to Do. You help advance the franchise by calling for votes, making sure you’re always on the side with the most votes, and resolving disputes within the franchise party.

> **Human Decisionist (Ranger)**

> There are decisionists of all stripes. Domineering narcissists gravitate toward the role, to be sure, and occasionally that unyielding demeanor has its purpose. Decisionist Annab approaches the role in another way, considering herself in many ways outside the party she travels with, even though she has served in this capacity for years. When she leverages her coin of decisionry, glinting with its final, unswerving resolve, it is because she has heard all.

As a rank 1 decisionist, you gain proficiency with a musical instrument (horn).

Head office also grants you the use of a musical instrument (your choice of [horn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/132-horn)), a voting kit (ballots, a ballot box, an “I Voted” sticker set), and a [coin of decisionry](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703529-coin-of-decisionry). This large gold coin is emblazoned with the sigil of Acquisitions Incorporated as “heads,” and has a “tails” image that varies.

Starting at rank 1, whenever the members of your franchise take a vote, you can present your [coin of decisionry](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703529-coin-of-decisionry) and cast two votes.

Starting at rank 2, if a member of your franchise party is absent, you gain their vote and can decide quite confidently how they would have voted. In addition, if a vote is ever taken while you are absent, you can call for a recount and add your two votes to the final voting result.

Starting at rank 2, your [coin of decisionry](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703529-coin-of-decisionry) becomes a common magic item. When you flip the coin, it always lands with the Acquisitions Incorporated sigil face down, and a message appears on the “tails” face. Roll a d4 on the following table to determine the message.

|d4|Decision|
|---|---|
|1|Lucrative|
|2|Brand Appeal|
|3|Indeterminate|
|4|Ruinous|

The coin has absolutely no divination abilities, and its results when you use it are random. But nobody else knows that. When a creature within 10 feet of you flips the coin (after having had its powerful prognostication powers dutifully explained), you can exert your will to control its operation as a bonus action, choosing the result that appears after it lands as a means of gently coercing the user toward a specific course of action. The creature flipping the coin can detect your manipulation with a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check.

When you reach rank 3, your [coin of decisionry](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703529-coin-of-decisionry) gains a measure of actual divination power and becomes an uncommon magic item. In addition to its normal function, you can use an action to flip the [coin of decisionry](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703529-coin-of-decisionry) twice while pondering a specific plan or objective, noting both random results. If you succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check, you learn which of the two results is more applicable to the course of action. This property of the coin can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Starting at rank 3, whenever a serious franchise vote is taken and the result goes the way you voted, you can inspire the rest of the franchise team with a brief speech. Make a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. On a success, each franchise member of your choice who can hear you gains advantage on the next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make in the next hour. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

As a rank 4 decisionist, you can present your [coin of decisionry](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703529-coin-of-decisionry) to grant yourself an extra vote when your franchise votes, for a total of three votes. Once you do so, you cannot do so again until dawn seven days later.

At rank 4, your [voting kit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703541-voting-kit) becomes a common magic item that conceals an extradimensional space. As a bonus action, you can place one tool kit that you are proficient with into the voting kit, or can remove it. No other type of object can be placed into the extradimensional space. A creature searching the voting kit finds and extracts the tool kit with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) or Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check.

Additionally, you can use the [voting kit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/703541-voting-kit) to cast [charm person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2025-charm-person) (save DC 15). This property of the kit can’t be used again until the next dawn.

> Decisionists work best when a verdict is unilateral and in direct contradiction to the rest of their team. Do the opposite of whatever they want, even if you want to do that thing too. It’s about setting an example and establishing a pecking order.
