Acquisitions, Inc. requires a set of Franchise-Level Roles to be filled by the owning party and their employees. Accepting a company position with Acquisitions Incorporated means more than just a title and hopes of a paycheck. With it comes access to trade secrets, best practices, and corporate shortcuts central to fulfilling one’s role within a franchise. When a character takes a specific company position, they gain training  in the tools and skills associated with that position. Such training also extends to a variety of business practices, day-to-day tasks, and hazard mitigations that are all part of the job. These required trainings seek to ensure the best possible function for any given franchise. 

Your Franchise-Level Role will grow alongside you in both responsibility and compensation, following a tiered system tied to your [[D&D/Faerun/Acquisitions Incorporated/Player Viewable/Franchise Management/Main Office Contracts/Main Office Ranking\|Main Office Ranking]].

Below is a list of the Franchise-Level Roles and their general responsibilities. More details, along with the function of Role-Specific equipment will be enclosed in the onboarding packets for each employee. 
## [[D&D/Faerun/Acquisitions Incorporated/Player Viewable/Franchise Management/Main Office Contracts/Onboarding Packets/Cartographer\|Cartographer]]
- Summary:
	- Acquisitions Incorporated missions can lead across vast tracts of wilderness, into ancient ruins, deep underground, or to even more dangerous and remote places. The cartographer selects the method and route of travel for a franchise, and creates and maintains maps of the journey. As the characters travel, the cartographer maps important locations and resources, later providing finished maps to Head Office. The franchise’s cartographer is also often responsible for the selection and care of vehicles and mounts.
	- As a cartographer, you have a sharp eye for detail and take an interest in people, history, and natural features. You help advance your franchise by discovering and mapping new locations or hidden features, acquiring rare maps, and using different modes of transportation in secure and clever ways.
- Essential Function:
	- Create and maintain maps of a franchise’s journeys; dictate directions.
- Position Skills:
	-  In addition to the skills noted, you can use your company equipment to help when you  create or examine maps, search for new paths in the wild, or assess a route for possible dangers.
## [[D&D/Faerun/Acquisitions Incorporated/Player Viewable/Franchise Management/Main Office Contracts/Onboarding Packets/Decisionist\|Decisionist]]
- Summary:
	- A decisionist brings decisive leadership to an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. They settle disputes and ensure that the team moves forward toward its goals, often serving as a leader (officially or otherwise) and compass for the party. A signature move of the decisionist is to impress the importance of a particular looming choice on the other franchisees, then call for a vote. The results of all franchise votes are recorded, then later reported to Head Office. Decisionists are also concerned with franchise morale and teamwork, helping all members of the franchise work together effectively.
	- All decisionists vary in their approach to the task. You might primarily attempt to convince others through charismatic arguments, or through force of will or intellectual cunning. You might lead by example, or by extolling the examples of other people who’ve done the things you haven’t quite gotten around to yet. Many decisionists go on to publish famous tomes, such as the best-selling Habits of Effective Adventuring Parties and I Don’t Care If the Rogue Stole Your Coins, We Have a Job to Do. You help advance the franchise by calling for votes, making sure you’re always on the side with the most votes, and resolving disputes within the franchise party.
- Essential Function:
	- Receive one extra vote on franchise matters; resolve interparty conflicts
- Position Skills:
	- In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can use your company equipment to help when you influence a decision being made by a group, assess the popularity of certain customs or individuals, or boost the morale of franchise hirelings.
## [[D&D/Faerun/Acquisitions Incorporated/Player Viewable/Franchise Management/Main Office Contracts/Onboarding Packets/Documancer\|Documancer]]
- Summary:
	- Every great Acquisitions Incorporated quest begins with a contract from Head Office — and a franchise’s documancer is most likely the one who controls and channels the power of that contract. A documancer bears the responsibility of managing each of a franchise’s quests, of ensuring that every condition of the quest is fulfilled, and of recording and sending on information vital to Head Office when the mission is complete. When creating contracts with other organizations, a documancer makes sure that the language benefits both the franchise and Acquisitions Incorporated.
	- As a documancer, you are respected for having the commitment and mental fortitude required to work with Head Office. You advance your franchise by using documancy for communication, insisting on recording all deals in writing, retaining records, destroying other records, and recalling vital information.
- Essential Function:
	- Record information; track job and quest details within the franchise
- Position Skills:
	- In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can use your company equipment to help when you organize lore, analyze official or arcane documents, or convey a legally binding point of view.
## [[D&D/Faerun/Acquisitions Incorporated/Player Viewable/Franchise Management/Main Office Contracts/Onboarding Packets/Hoardsperson\|Hoardsperson]]
- Summary:
	- As the name suggests, Acquisitions Incorporated is all about the acquiring, and the hoardsperson’s job is all about storing that hard-earned loot. Each hoards­person plays the vital role of managing a franchise’s resources — including the inventory of all supplies used and treasure gained during an adventure. Hoards­persons pay particular attention to making sure that supplies are requisitioned through Acquisitions Incorporated-approved sources whenever possible, and ensuring that the proper selection of loot is sent to Head Office at the end of a mission.
	- As a hoards­person, you are known as a trustworthy and responsible individual. You support your franchise by demonstrating accuracy, avoiding shortfalls, and anticipating resource needs.
- Essential Function:
	- Manage stores and items; track resources
- Position Skills:
	- In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can use your company equipment to help when you negotiate a price for goods and services, assess the quality of equipment and treasure, or analyze resources in a local area.
## [[D&D/Faerun/Acquisitions Incorporated/Player Viewable/Franchise Management/Main Office Contracts/Onboarding Packets/Loremonger\|Loremonger]]
- Summary:
	- Information has value, and the loremonger is that information’s keeper. A franchise’s loremonger studies and records all lore relevant to its operation, including tracking the economic, technical, and arcane methods by which the franchise can be improved. A loremonger records the deeds and history of the franchise, including the names of places visited and people met during missions. Those records are then sent to Head Office (often through a franchise’s documancer) to ensure brand integrity.
	- As a loremonger, you are a studious individual, usually with an interest in history or technical subjects. You might revel in your role, working as a central figure in your franchise as you use your knowledge to promote it. Or you might operate from the shadows, resembling a clever spymaster and allowing others to be the franchise’s public face. You help advance your franchise by discovering secrets, tracking important lore gained during the characters’ travels, and reporting on competitors’ goals and methods.
- Essential Function:
	- Record names, dates, and vital information
- Position Skills:
	- In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can ause your company equipment to help when you analyze the operation of a franchise, assess historical records, or decipher codes.
## [[D&D/Faerun/Acquisitions Incorporated/Player Viewable/Franchise Management/Main Office Contracts/Onboarding Packets/Obviator\|Obviator]]
- Summary:
	- Obstacles abound along the path to riches. A franchise’s mission success might require combating a rival organization’s disinformation attempts one day, then besting a castle’s defenses the next. The day after that, some poor sap named Bob might need to be disposed of. And no matter what the type of challenge that needs to be overcome, the franchise’s obviator determines the optimal way to shut down and destroy that challenge. (Nothing personal, Bob. It’s just business.)
	- As an obviator, you hatch convoluted plots to fight the overwhelming odds presented by each mission — by whatever means are necessary. Sometimes, you might prefer brute strength and improvisation. Other times, you might undertake a deep study of conflicts and rival organizations, working carefully to stay three steps ahead of the opposition. In all cases, though, you help advance your franchise by hatching effective plans and tactics, anticipating problems, and learning about your foes — ideally before they can treat you as an obstacle to their own success.
- Essential Function:
	- Destroy targets (people and information); study conflicts
- Position Skills:
	- In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can use your company equipment to help when you make sense of an enemy’s tactics, discern a hidden threat, or intimidate a foe whose weaknesses you have previously assessed (see “Read the Opposition” below).
## [[D&D/Faerun/Acquisitions Incorporated/Player Viewable/Franchise Management/Main Office Contracts/Onboarding Packets/Occultant\|Occultant]]
- Summary:
	- An occultant tracks the creatures and foes that a franchise has bested or killed, weighing them against the deeds the franchise has achieved. Using the eldritch abacus for which this position is named, an occultant measures the karmic coordinates of their franchise, hoping to gain portents of that which is yet to come.
	- Like all occultants, you are a grim and enigmatic figure. Even your closest companions might be wary of the power you channel — and nobody wears that aura of dark mystery like you do. You help advance your franchise by determining whether foes should live or die, prognosticating correctly (or at least authoritatively), keeping the rest of the party attuned to the importance of karma, and making the right calls on how best to “clean up” any incorrect readings or misunderstandings.
- Essential Function:
	- Track kills; assess the value to the franchise of the living and the dead
- Position Skills:
	- In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can use your company equipment to help when you intimidate a creature close to death, assess what disease or poison killed a creature, or explain what that dead body is doing under your bed at the inn.
## [[D&D/Faerun/Acquisitions Incorporated/Player Viewable/Franchise Management/Main Office Contracts/Onboarding Packets/Secretarian\|Secretarian]]
- Summary:
	- A secretarian’s focus is on people — and all the potential value that might be wrung out of them. Every person met outside a franchise is a potential customer to a secretarian, who does whatever they can to bring that relationship to fulfillment. A secretarian seeks always to promote their franchise and gain greater value than they give. They have the skills to negotiate with subemployees, temporary hirelings, seasonal staff, and other humanoid (usually) resources. When staff members have problems, the secretarian is the one who patiently listens (or at least pretends to) until everything calms down.
	- As a secretarian, you are respected for having the fortitude to listen to both customers and coworkers without going insane. You help advance your franchise by keeping staff happy (enough), hiring competent (enough) workers, coming up with slogans and catchphrases, launching marketing schemes, and getting jingles and slogans stuck in customer’s heads. And while your superiors don’t officially condone undermining the branding efforts of other organizations, no one can argue with the effectiveness of that approach.
- Essential Function:
	- Extract information; assess the strengths and weaknesses of others
- Position Skills:
	- In addition to the proficiencies noted below, you can use your company equipment to help when you convince a suspicious crowd of your good (or at least non-evil) intentions, encourage franchise hirelings to work faster, or improvise a jingle extolling the virtues of your franchise.
