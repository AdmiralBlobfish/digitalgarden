- Majordomo
	- Typically live in the headquarters and seldom leave it, sending out communications through a dedicated messenger. 
	- Proficient in Persuasion and two other skills.
	- Cost covered by monthly dues.
- Untrained Hirelings (Sub-employees)
	- Provide general labor, functioning as builders, cleaners, porters, and other workers. 
	- Are not expected to engage in combat and do not leave the headquarters to join the owning party on adventures.
- Skilled Hirelings (Interns)
	- Has one or more skill, weapon, or tool proficiencies.
	- Can be requested when needed (up to a maximum based on franchise rank), with the players describing the concept behind the hirelings and selecting one proficiency for each. The main office will then begin the search for the requested skills in their onboarded list of Interns, assigning them to the franchise for a small fee. The franchise is also free to search for Interns on their own, but all Interns must go through Acq. Inc. onboarding procedures processed by the local Majordomo.
	- Skilled Hirelings can be fired and hired as needed. A franchise might bring on a couple of thugs to act as a distraction during a street fair, then release those NPCs to hire a different set of skilled hirelings to conduct franchise tasks and downtime activities.
	- Can only perform one task at a time. A full complement of skilled hirelings assisting with a mission or adventure, for example, precludes any other skilled hirelings from helping with franchise tasks and downtime activities until the mission is completed.
	- ***Adventuring**:* The owning party can adventure with up to one skilled hireling at a time. An NPC with a CR of half the franchise rank is a good fit.
	- ***Tasks and Downtime:*** Skilled Hirelings can also be assigned to franchise tasks, as described in the "Franchise Tasks and Downtime" section.
- Crew
	- Skilled hirelings trained in tasks pertaining to the physical maintenance of a franchise (for example, servers or gardeners), navigation of a mobile headquarters such as seafaring franchises, engineers for headquarters functions, and so on. They are not expected to participate in combat, and cannot be required to leave the headquarters for franchise activities. 
	- If the franchise requires more crew than granted by their main office ranking, the characters must personally hire the remainder at their own cost. Acq Inc recommends the industry standard of 2 gp per day for payment, but it is up to the franchise and the hired individuals to determine the details of their contract.
	- Acq Inc recommends hiring crew that have established rapport with each other to improve efficiency. This could be ex-militia, failed business employees (hopefully not parties at fault for the failure), or a group of sailors, for example.
- Messenger
	- Acq Inc will provide one messenger assigned to your franchise at no cost. Additional messaging services are due for payment through the franchise coffers.
