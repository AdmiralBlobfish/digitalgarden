# Downtime
## Crafting
 ***Xanathar***
- A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear.
- Resources and Resolution. In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item’s selling cost. To determine how many workweeks it takes to create an item, divide its gold piece cost by 50. A character can complete multiple items in a workweek if the items’ combined cost is 50 gp or lower. Items that cost more than 50 gp can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location.
- Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Use your judgment when determining how many characters can collaborate on an item. A particularly tiny item, like a ring, might allow only one or two workers, whereas a large, complex item might allow four or more workers.
- A character needs to be proficient with the tools needed to craft an item and have access to the appropriate equipment. Everyone who collaborates needs to have the appropriate tool proficiency. You need to make any judgment calls regarding whether a character has the correct equipment. The following table provides some examples.

| Proficiency           | Items                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Herbalism kit         | Antitoxin, [potion of healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/8960641-potion-of-healing) |
| Leatherworker’s tools | Leather armor, boots                                                                            |
| Smith’s tools         | Armor, weapons                                                                                  |
| Weaver’s tools        | Cloaks, robes                                                                                   |

If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is an item of the desired sort. A character can sell an item crafted in this way at its listed price.
## Crafting a Magic Item
 ***Xanathar***
- Crafting Magic Items. Creating a magic item requires more than just time, effort, and materials. It is a long-term process that involves one or more adventures to track down rare materials and the lore needed to create the item.

[Potions of healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing) and [spell scrolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/spell-scroll) are exceptions to the following rules. For more information, see “Brewing Potions of Healing” later in this section and the “[Scribing a Spell Scroll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/xgte/downtime-revisited#ScribingaSpellScroll)” section, below.

To start with, a character needs a formula for a magic item in order to create it. The formula is like a recipe. It lists the materials needed and steps required to make the item.

An item invariably requires an exotic material to complete it. This material can range from the skin of a yeti to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool on the Elemental Plane of Water. Finding that material should take place as part of an adventure.

The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature that the characters need to face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that the characters need access to.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#MagicItemIngredients)Magic Item Ingredients

|Item Rarity|CR Range|
|---|---|
|Common|1–3|
|Uncommon|4–8|
|Rare|9–12|
|Very rare|13–18|
|Legendary|19+|

If appropriate, pick a monster or a location that is a thematic fit for the item to be crafted. For example, creating [mariner’s armor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5507-mariners-armor) might require the essence of a [water weird](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17208-water-weird). Crafting a [staff of charming](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4760-staff-of-charming) might require the cooperation of a specific [arcanaloth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17109-arcanaloth), who will help only if the characters complete a task for it. Making a [staff of power](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4764-staff-of-power) might hinge on acquiring a piece of an ancient stone that was once touched by the god of magic — a stone now guarded by a suspicious [androsphinx](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16785-androsphinx).

In addition to facing a specific creature, creating an item comes with a gold piece cost covering other materials, tools, and so on, based on the item’s rarity. Those values, as well as the time a character needs to work in order to complete the item, are shown on the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table. Halve the listed price and creation time for any consumable items.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#MagicItemCraftingTimeAndCost)Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost

|Item Rarity|Workweeks*|Cost*|
|---|---|---|
|Common|1|50 gp|
|Uncommon|2|200 gp|
|Rare|10|2,000 gp|
|Very rare|25|20,000 gp|
|Legendary|50|100,000 gp|

*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll

To complete a magic item, a character also needs whatever tool proficiency is appropriate, as for crafting a nonmagical object, or proficiency in the [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) skill.

If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is a magic item of the desired sort.

Complications. Most of the complications involved in creating something, especially a magic item, are linked to the difficulty in finding rare ingredients or components needed to complete the work. The complications a character might face as byproducts of the creation process are most interesting when the characters are working on a magic item: there’s a 10 percent chance for every five workweeks spent on crafting an item that a complication occurs. The Crafting Complications table provides examples of what might happen.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#CraftingComplications)Crafting Complications

|d6|Complication|
|---|---|
|1|Rumors swirl that what you’re working on is unstable and a threat to the community.*|
|2|Your tools are stolen, forcing you to buy new ones.*|
|3|A local wizard shows keen interest in your work and insists on observing you.|
|4|A powerful noble offers a hefty price for your work and is not interested in hearing no for an answer.*|
|5|A dwarf clan accuses you of stealing its secret lore to fuel your work.*|
|6|A competitor spreads rumors that your work is shoddy and prone to failure.*|

*Might involve a rival

Brewing Potions of Healing. Potions of healing fall into a special category for item crafting, separate from other magic items. A character who has proficiency with the herbalism kit can create these potions. The times and costs for doing so are summarized on the Potion of Healing Creation table.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#PotionOfHealingCreation)Potion of Healing Creation

| Type             | Time        | Cost      |
| ---------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Healing          | 1 day       | 25 gp     |
| Greater healing  | 1 workweek  | 100 gp    |
| Superior healing | 3 workweeks | 1,000 gp  |
| Supreme healing  | 4 workweeks | 10,000 gp |
## Practicing a Profession
***Xanathar***
- When all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest trade to earn a living. This activity represents a character’s attempt to find temporary work, the quality and wages of which are difficult to predict.

Resources. Performing a job requires one workweek of effort.

Resolution. To determine how much money a character earns, the character makes an ability check: Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)), Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)), Intelligence using a set of tools, Charisma ([Performance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)), or Charisma using a musical instrument. Consult the Wages table to see how much money is generated according to the total of the check.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#Wages)Wages

|Check Total|Earnings|
|---|---|
|9 or lower|Poor lifestyle for the week|
|10–14|Modest lifestyle for the week|
|15–20|Comfortable lifestyle for the week|
|21+|Comfortable lifestyle for the week + 25 gp|

Complications. Ordinary work is rarely filled with significant complications. Still, the Work Complications table can add some difficulties to a worker’s life. Each workweek of activity brings a 10 percent chance that a character encounters a complication.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#WorkComplications)Work Complications

|d6|Complication|
|---|---|
|1|A difficult customer or a fight with a coworker reduces the wages you earn by one category.*|
|2|Your employer’s financial difficulties result in your not being paid.*|
|3|A coworker with ties to an important family in town takes a dislike to you.*|
|4|Your employer is involved with a dark cult or a criminal enterprise.|
|5|A crime ring targets your business for extortion.*|
|6|You gain a reputation for laziness (unjustified or not, as you choose), giving you disadvantage on checks made for this downtime activity for the next six workweeks you devote to it.*|
Might involve a rival
## Relaxation
***Xanathar***
- Sometimes the best thing to do between adventures is relax. Whether a character wants a hard-earned vacation or needs to recover from injuries, relaxation is the ideal option for adventurers who need a break. This option is also ideal for players who don’t want to make use of the downtime system. 
- ***Resources***. Relaxation requires one week. A character needs to maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing to gain the benefit of the activity.
- ***Resolution***. Characters who maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing gain several benefits. While relaxing, a character gains advantage on saving throws to recover from long-acting diseases and poisons. In addition, at the end of the week, a character can end one effect that keeps the character from regaining hit points, or can restore one ability score that has been reduced to less than its normal value. This benefit cannot be used if the harmful effect was caused by a spell or some other magical effect with an ongoing duration.
- ***Complications***. Relaxation rarely comes with complications. If you want to make life complicated for the characters, introduce an action or an event connected to a rival.
## Recuperating
***PHB***
- You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.
- After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:
- End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.
- For the next 24 hours, gain [advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage) on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.
## Researching
Forewarned is forearmed. The research downtime activity allows a character to delve into lore concerning a monster, a location, a magic item, or some other particular topic.

Resources. Typically, a character needs access to a library or a sage to conduct research. Assuming such access is available, conducting research requires one workweek of effort and at least 50 gp spent on materials, bribes, gifts, and other expenses.

Resolution. The character declares the focus of the research — a specific person, place, or thing. After one workweek, the character makes an Intelligence check with a +1 bonus per 50 gp spent beyond the initial 50 gp, to a maximum of +6. In addition, a character who has access to a particularly well-stocked library or knowledgeable sages gains advantage on this check. Determine how much lore a character learns using the Research Outcomes table.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#ResearchOutcomes)Research Outcomes

|Check Total|Outcome|
|---|---|
|1–5|No effect.|
|6–10|You learn one piece of lore.|
|11–20|You learn two pieces of lore.|
|21+|You learn three pieces of lore.|
Each piece of lore is the equivalent of one true statement about a person, place, or thing. Examples include knowledge of a creature’s resistances, the password needed to enter a sealed dungeon level, the spells commonly prepared by an order of wizards, and so on.

As DM, you are the final arbiter concerning exactly what a character learns. For a monster or an NPC, you can reveal elements of statistics or personality. For a location, you can reveal secrets about it, such as a hidden entrance, the answer to a riddle, or the nature of a creature that guards the place.

Complications. The greatest risk in research is uncovering false information. Not all lore is accurate or truthful, and a rival with a scholarly bent might try to lead the character astray, especially if the object of the research is known to the rival. The rival might plant false information, bribe sages to give bad advice, or steal key tomes needed to find the truth.

In addition, a character might run into other complications during research. Every workweek spent in research brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Research Complications table.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#ResearchComplications)Research Complications

| d6  | Complication                                                                                |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | You accidentally damage a rare book.                                                        |
| 2   | You offend a sage, who demands an extravagant gift.                                         |
| 3   | If you had known that book was cursed, you never would have opened it.                      |
| 4   | A sage becomes obsessed with convincing you of a number of strange theories about reality.* |
| 5   | Your actions cause you to be banned from a library until you make reparations.              |
| 6   | You uncovered useful lore, but only by promising to complete a dangerous task in return.    |
## Training
Given enough free time and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language or pick up proficiency with a tool.

***Resources***. Receiving training in a language or tool typically takes at least ten workweeks, but this time is reduced by a number of workweeks equal to the character’s Intelligence modifier (an Intelligence penalty doesn’t increase the time needed). Training costs 25 gp per workweek.

***Complications***. Complications that arise while training typically involve the teacher. Every ten workweeks spent in training brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Training Complications table.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#TrainingComplications)Training Complications

|d6|Complication|
|---|---|
|1|Your instructor disappears, forcing you to spend one workweek finding a new one.*|
|2|Your teacher instructs you in rare, archaic methods, which draw comments from others.|
|3|Your teacher is a spy sent to learn your plans.*|
|4|Your teacher is a wanted criminal.|
|5|Your teacher is a cruel taskmaster.|
|6|Your teacher asks for help dealing with a threat.|
## Buying a Magic Item
Purchasing a magic item requires time and money to seek out and contact people willing to sell items. Even then, there is no guarantee a seller will have the items a character desires.

Resources. Finding magic items to purchase requires at least one workweek of effort and 100 gp in expenses. Spending more time and money increases your chance of finding a high-quality item.

Resolution. A character seeking to buy a magic item makes a Charisma ([Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to determine the quality of the seller found. The character gains a +1 bonus on the check for every workweek beyond the first that is spent seeking a seller and a +1 bonus for every additional 100 gp spent on the search, up to a maximum bonus of +10. The monetary cost includes a wealthy lifestyle, for a buyer must impress potential business partners.

As shown on the Buying Magic Items table, the total of the check dictates which table in the _[Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg)_ to roll on to determine which items are on the market. Or you can roll for items from any table associated with a lower total on the Buying Magic Items table. As a further option to reflect the availability of items in your campaign, you can apply a −10 penalty for low magic campaigns or a +10 bonus for high magic campaigns. Furthermore, you can double magic item costs in low magic campaigns.

Using the Magic Item Price table, you then assign prices to the available items, based on their rarity. Halve the price of any consumable item, such as a potion or a scroll, when using the table to determine an asking price.

You have final say in determining which items are for sale and their final price, no matter what the tables say.

If the characters seek a specific magic item, first decide if it’s an item you want to allow in your game. If so, include the desired item among the items for sale on a check total of 10 or higher if the item is common, 15 or higher if it is uncommon, 20 or higher if it is rare, 25 or higher if it is very rare, and 30 or higher if it is legendary.
#### Buying Magic Items

|Check Total|Items Acquired|
|---|---|
|1–5|Roll 1d6 times on [Magic Item Table A](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#MagicItemTableA "Magic Item Table A").|

Complications. The magic item trade is fraught with peril. The large sums of money involved and the power offered by magic items attract thieves, con artists, and other villains. If you want to make things more interesting for the characters, roll on the Magic Item Purchase Complications table or invent your own complication.

|10|The item is an enslaved, intelligent entity.|
|11|The item is tied to a cult.|
|12|The party’s enemies spread rumors that the item is an artifact of evil.*|
## Selling a Magic Item
Selling a magic item is by no means an easy task. Con artists and thieves are always looking out for an easy score, and there’s no guarantee that a character will receive a good offer even if a legitimate buyer is found.

Resources. A character can find a buyer for one magic item by spending one workweek and 25 gp, which is used to spread word of the desired sale. A character must pick one item at a time to sell.

Resolution. A character who wants to sell an item must make a Charisma ([Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to determine what kind of offer comes in. The character can always opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the workweek of effort and trying again later. Use the Magic Item Base Prices and Magic Item Offer tables to determine the sale price.

|Rarity|Base Price*|
|---|---|

|Very rare|40,000 gp|
|Legendary|200,000 gp|

*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll

Complications. The main risk in selling a magic item lies in attracting thieves and anyone else who wants the item but doesn’t want to pay for it. Other folk might try to undermine a deal in order to bolster their own business or seek to discredit the character as a legitimate seller. Every workweek spent trying to sell an item brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Magic Item Sale Complications table.

## Carousing
Carousing is a default downtime activity for many characters. Between adventures, who doesn’t want to relax with a few drinks and a group of friends at a tavern?

Resources. Carousing covers a workweek of fine food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can attempt to carouse among lower-, middle-, or upper-class folk. A character can carouse with the lower class for 10 gp to cover expenses, or 50 gp for the middle class. Carousing with the upper class requires 250 gp for the workweek and access to the local nobility.

A character with the noble background can mingle with the upper class, but other characters can do so only if you judge that the character has made sufficient contacts. Alternatively, a character might use a disguise kit and the [Deception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) skill to pass as a noble visiting from a distant city.

Resolution. After a workweek of carousing, a character stands to make contacts within the selected social class. The character makes a Charisma ([Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check using the Carousing table.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#Carousing2)Carousing

|Check Total|Result|
|---|---|
|1–5|Character has made a hostile contact.|
|6–10|Character has made no new contacts.|
|11–15|Character has made an allied contact.|
|16–20|Character has made two allied contacts.|
|21+|Character has made three allied contacts.|

Contacts are NPCs who now share a bond with the character. Each one either owes the character a favor or has some reason to bear a grudge. A hostile contact works against the character, placing obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or a violent act. Allied contacts are friends who will render aid to the character, but not at the risk of their lives.

Lower-class contacts include criminals, laborers, mercenaries, the town guard, and any other folk who normally frequent the cheapest taverns in town.

Middle-class contacts include guild members, spellcasters, town officials, and other folk who frequent well-kept establishments.

Upper-class contacts are nobles and their personal servants. Carousing with such folk covers formal banquets, state dinners, and the like.

Once a contact has helped or hindered a character, the character needs to carouse again to get back into the NPC’s good graces. A contact provides help once, not help for life. The contact remains friendly, which can influence roleplaying and how the characters interact with them, but doesn’t come with a guarantee of help.

You can assign specific NPCs as contacts. You might decide that the barkeep at the Wretched Gorgon and a guard stationed at the western gate are the character’s allied contacts. Assigning specific NPCs gives the players concrete options. It brings the campaign to life and seeds the area with NPCs that the characters care about. On the other hand, it can prove difficult to track and might render a contact useless if that character doesn’t come into play.

Alternatively, you can allow the player to make an NPC into a contact on the spot, after carousing. When the characters are in the area in which they caroused, a player can expend an allied contact and designate an NPC they meet as a contact, assuming the NPC is of the correct social class based on how the character caroused. The player should provide a reasonable explanation for this relationship and work it into the game.

Using a mix of the two approaches is a good idea, since it gives you the added depth of specific contacts while giving players the freedom to ensure that the contacts they accumulate are useful.

The same process can apply to hostile contacts. You can give the characters a specific NPC they should avoid, or you might introduce one at an inopportune or dramatic moment.

At any time, a character can have a maximum number of unspecified allied contacts equal to 1 + the character’s Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Specific, named contacts don’t count toward this limit — only ones that can be used at any time to declare an NPC as a contact.

Complications. Characters who carouse risk bar brawls, accumulating a cloud of nasty rumors, and building a bad reputation around town. As a rule of thumb, a character has a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication for each workweek of carousing.

## Crime
Sometimes it pays to be bad. This activity gives a character the chance to make some extra cash, at the risk of arrest.

Resources. A character must spend one week and at least 25 gp gathering information on potential targets before committing the intended crime.

Resolution. The character must make a series of checks, with the DC for all the checks chosen by the character according to the amount of profit sought from the crime.

The chosen DC can be 10, 15, 20, or 25. Successful completion of the crime yields a number of gold pieces, as shown on the Loot Value table.

To attempt a crime, the character makes three checks: Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)), Dexterity using thieves’ tools, and the player’s choice of Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)), Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)), or Charisma ([Deception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)).

If none of the checks are successful, the character is caught and jailed. The character must pay a fine equal to the profit the crime would have earned and must spend one week in jail for each 25 gp of the fine.

If only one check is successful, the heist fails but the character escapes.

If two checks are successful, the heist is a partial success, netting the character half the payout.

If all three checks are successful, the character earns the full value of the loot.

|DC|Value|
|---|---|

|15|100 gp, robbery of a prosperous merchant|
|20|200 gp, robbery of a noble|
|25|1,000 gp, robbery of one of the richest figures in town|

Complications. A life of crime is filled with complications. Roll on the Crime Complications table (or create a complication of your own) if the character succeeds on only one check. If the character’s rival is involved in crime or law enforcement, a complication ensues if the character succeeds on only two checks.

## Gambling
Games of chance are a way to make a fortune — and perhaps a better way to lose one.

Resources. This activity requires one workweek of effort plus a stake of at least 10 gp, to a maximum of 1,000 gp or more, as you see fit.

Resolution. The character must make a series of checks, with a DC determined at random based on the quality of the competition that the character runs into. Part of the risk of gambling is that one never knows who might end up sitting across the table.

The character makes three checks: Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)), Charisma ([Deception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)), and Charisma ([Intimidation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)). If the character has proficiency with an appropriate gaming set, that tool proficiency can replace the relevant skill in any of the checks. The DC for each of the checks is 5 + 2d10; generate a separate DC for each one. Consult the Gambling Results table to see how the character did.

|0 successes|Lose all the money you bet, and accrue a debt equal to that amount.|
|1 success|Lose half the money you bet.|
|2 successes|Gain the amount you bet plus half again more.|
|3 successes|Gain double the amount you bet.|

Complications. Gambling tends to attract unsavory individuals. The potential complications involved come from run-ins with the law and associations with various criminals tied to the activity. Every workweek spent gambling brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Gambling Complications table.

## Pit Fighting
Pit fighting includes boxing, wrestling, and other nonlethal forms of combat in an organized setting with predetermined matches. If you want to introduce competitive fighting in a battle-to-the-death situation, the standard combat rules apply to that sort of activity.

Resources. Engaging in this activity requires one workweek of effort from a character.

Resolution. The character must make a series of checks, with a DC determined at random based on the quality of the opposition that the character runs into. A big part of the challenge in pit fighting lies in the unknown nature of a character’s opponents.

The character makes three checks: Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)), Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)), and a special Constitution check that has a bonus equal to a roll of the character’s largest Hit Die (this roll doesn’t spend that die). If desired, the character can replace one of these skill checks with an attack roll using one of the character’s weapons. The DC for each of the checks is 5 + 2d10; generate a separate DC for each one. Consult the Pit Fighting Results table to see how the character did.

## Religious Service
Characters with a religious bent might want to spend downtime in service to a temple, either by attending rites or by proselytizing in the community. Someone who undertakes this activity has a chance of winning the favor of the temple’s leaders.

Resources. Performing religious service requires access to, and often attendance at, a temple whose beliefs and ethos align with the character’s. If such a place is available, the activity takes one workweek of time but involves no gold piece expenditure.

Resolution. At the end of the required time, the character chooses to make either an Intelligence ([Religion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check or a Charisma ([Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. The total of the check determines the benefits of service, as shown on the Religious Service table.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#ReligiousService2)Religious Service

|Check Total|Result|
|---|---|
|1–10|No effect. Your efforts fail to make a lasting impression.|
|11–20|You earn one favor.|
|21+|You earn two favors.|

A favor, in broad terms, is a promise of future assistance from a representative of the temple. It can be expended to ask the temple for help in dealing with a specific problem, for general political or social support, or to reduce the cost of cleric spellcasting by 50 percent. A favor could also take the form of a deity’s intervention, such as an omen, a vision, or a minor miracle provided at a key moment. This latter sort of favor is expended by the DM, who also determines its nature.

Favors earned need not be expended immediately, but only a certain number can be stored up. A character can have a maximum number of unused favors equal to 1 + the character’s Charisma modifier (minimum of one unused favor).

Complications. Temples can be labyrinths of political and social scheming. Even the best-intentioned sect can fall prone to rivalries. A character who serves a temple risks becoming embroiled in such struggles. Every workweek spent in religious service brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Religious Service Complications table.

## Scribing a Spell Scroll
With time and patience, a spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll, creating a spell scroll.

Resources. Scribing a [spell scroll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5418-spell-scroll) takes an amount of time and money related to the level of the spell the character wants to scribe, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. In addition, the character must have proficiency in the [Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) skill and must provide any material components required for the casting of the spell. Moreover, the character must have the spell prepared, or it must be among the character’s known spells, in order to scribe a scroll of that spell.

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were 1st level.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte/downtime-revisited#SpellScrollCosts)Spell Scroll Costs

|Spell Level|Time|Cost|
|---|---|---|
|Cantrip|1 day|15 gp|
|1st|1 day|25 gp|
|2nd|3 days|250 gp|
|3rd|1 workweek|500 gp|
|4th|2 workweeks|2,500 gp|
|5th|4 workweeks|5,000 gp|
|6th|8 workweeks|15,000 gp|
|7th|16 workweeks|25,000 gp|
|8th|32 workweeks|50,000 gp|
|9th|48 workweeks|250,000 gp|

Complications. Crafting a [spell scroll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5418-spell-scroll) is a solitary task, unlikely to attract much attention. The complications that arise are more likely to involve the preparation needed for the activity. Every workweek spent scribing brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Scribe a Scroll Complications table.

# Franchise Tasks
## Explore Territory
No matter how densely populated or remote and wild the territory in which a franchise is licensed to operate, that territory has secrets. Characters and franchise staff can explore their licensed territory in search of useful features, hidden lairs, resources, and creatures that can be engaged in beneficial service. (Or, you know, sold for parts. If you’re okay with that). Exploration can be done any number of times in a franchise’s territory, representing new areas being explored, new discoveries, or elements that have changed since the last exploration.

Resources. Exploring a portion of a licensed territory requires at least one workweek of effort and incurs 200 gp per franchise rank in expenses. Spending more time and money increases the chance that the expedition finds something of use to the franchise.

Resolution. A character or staff member directing the expedition makes a Wisdom ([Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to determine the outcome. This check gains a +2 bonus if a character with the cartographer or occultant position is part of the expedition, a +1 bonus for each workweek beyond the first that is spent exploring, and a +1 bonus for every additional 200 gp spent over the baseline expenses. A maximum bonus of +10 can be applied to this check. The total of the check determines the outcome, as shown on the Exploration Discoveries table.

Exploration Discoveries

|Check Total|Discovery|
|---|---|
|1–5|Major threat*|
|6–10|Minor threat*|
|11–15|No discovery of note|
|16–20|Natural feature|
|21–25|New customers|
|26–30|Ally or useful monster|
|31+|Expanded benefit|

*Might involve a rival

Major Threat. A result on the table indicating a major threat represents a discovery, event, or entity that might completely undo a franchise’s ability to do business — or destroy it altogether. Such threats might include the discovery of a massing orc tribe, or a dragon entering the area to raid the franchise’s trade routes. The franchise’s monthly costs increase by 50 percent until the threat is resolved, as determined by the DM.

Minor Threat. A minor threat to the franchise involves uncovering a danger that can disrupt the characters’ ability to conduct business effectively. Such threats might arise from stumbling upon the lair of a monster, learning of the machinations of a noble, or discovering a rival’s outpost. The franchise’s monthly costs increase by 25 percent until the threat is resolved, as determined by the DM.

Natural Feature. The expedition could locate timber, precious metals, or other valuable natural resources; a feature that serves as a lookout or offers defensive value; a location that can serve as a safe house; or the like. Valuable resources lower a franchise’s monthly costs by 25 percent for 1d4 + 1 months. Other natural features can offer material benefits in future gaming sessions. For example, a tall spire of rock could serve as a watchtower, allowing the franchise to gain advance warning of any large-scale forces moving through their territory. A cave network acting as a safe house could allow the franchise to conceal goods or people in times of trouble.

New Customers. A new settlement is discovered in the territory, and the people there are eager to deal. These could be newcomers settling the area or a previously unnoticed village or group of farmsteads. The presence of new customers lowers franchise costs by 25 percent for 2d4 months before rivals catch wind of them.

Ally or Useful Monster. The dwelling of a useful ally, such as a sage or a former franchise member, is discovered. This ally can become a source of lore, providing insights into one or more campaign secrets — for a low, low fee of 100 gp times the franchise tier for each secret. The party can also make one-time use of the ally to lower franchise costs by 50 percent for 1d4 months, after which the ally departs.

The expedition could instead locate a monster that is either willing to help the party or can be tamed. The challenge rating of the monster is typically equal to franchise rank, and providing for the monster’s needs costs 100 gp per month. This monster could serve as a scout or spy, alerting the franchise to danger in its territory. Or it could serve as a mount or guardian and be based in the franchise headquarters. Such a monster remains with the franchise as long as its costs are covered and it is treated well.

Expanded Benefit. The DM chooses whether the expedition turns up a natural feature, new customers, or an ally or useful monster, then increases the benefit or reduces the cost of that discovery. Natural resources might be found in greater abundance, an ally might provide secrets for half the normal fee, a monster might be of a higher challenge rating than normal, and so on.

Complications. A result of 1–10 on the Exploration Discoveries table is its own complication, but the DM can add unexpected side effects to a successful result by choosing from or rolling on the Explore Territory Complications table.

## Franchise Restructuring
A growing franchise often needs fine-tuning to improve its operations and remain lean and capable. Efficiency measures, bold new paradigms, shiny business plans, internal audits, and inventory management can be key to new profits. The best plans often end up creating an auxiliary market for “how-to” books, such as Can’t-Miss Principles of Franchise Reinvisionary Strategery and What to Inquire about How to Acquire. In some campaigns, Head Office might periodically require this task to ensure that a franchise grows effectively.

Resources. Boldly restructuring a franchise requires at least two workweeks of effort. The franchise must also spend 100 gp per franchise rank in expenses. Spending more time and money increases the characters’ chance to effectively restructure their franchise.

Resolution. Characters or staff members in charge of the restructuring make two ability checks with a DC of 13 + franchise rank. First, a character or staff member must succeed at either an Intelligence ([History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) or Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to select the right vision or identify the right areas to innovate. This check gains a +1 bonus for every character with the loremonger or hoards­person position in the franchise, and an additional +1 bonus if the character making the check has one of those positions.

A character or staff member must then make a Charisma ([Deception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Performance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to get all other characters and staff on board with the prescribed changes. This check gains a +1 bonus for each decisionist or secretarian in the franchise, and an additional +1 bonus if the character making the check has one of those positions.

All checks gain a +1 bonus for every two workweeks beyond the initial time that is spent undertaking this activity. Each check also gains a +1 bonus for every additional 100 gp spent over the baseline expenses. A maximum bonus of +10 can be applied to each check.

The total number of successes determines the outcome of the activity, as noted on the Franchise Restructuring table.

Franchise Restructuring

|Successes|Benefit|
|---|---|
|0|The restructuring plan is a failure. The franchise’s monthly costs increase by 20 percent for 1 month.|
|1|The restructuring plan provides minor benefits. The franchise’s monthly costs decrease by 10 percent for 1d4 months.|
|2|The restructuring plan provides strong benefits. The franchise’s monthly costs decrease by 20 percent for 1d4 months.|

Complications. A result of 0 successes typically indicates that the failed restructuring results in a complication. At the DM’s discretion, even a successful outcome might have unexpected side effects. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Franchise Restructuring Complications table.

## Headquarters Modification
Major headquarters modifications are made as a regular part of franchise advancement (see “[Franchise Advancement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ai/growing-your-franchise#FranchiseAdvancement "Franchise Advancement")” earlier in this chapter). But it’s sometimes desirable to update a previous modification in ways that don’t provide any additional mechanical benefits.

Characters and franchise staff members can use this activity to modify an existing headquarters feature. This change is subject to DM approval, and is typically done within the same feature category, such as swapping one weapon option for another. In response to pressing need, the DM might allow a franchise to swap options between categories, such as losing a weapon option in favor of an arcane option. The DM can limit how often this activity is used.

Resources. Once a modification is approved, this activity requires the involvement of the franchise’s majordomo and at least one other character or staff member. This team must dedicate at least three workweeks to this activity, and the franchise must spend 1,000 gp per franchise rank to cover expenses. The DM might also require a side trek to gather necessary materials or hire specialist labor before the activity can be commenced.

Resolution. One character or the majordomo acts as the lead for this activity, making an Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) or [History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to draft the modifications. A character or the majordomo must then make two ability checks to complete the modifications, using either Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) or an Intelligence check using appropriate tools. With DM approval, a different ability and skill appropriate for the modification can be substituted for any of the checks.

Each check receives a +1 bonus for every two staff participating who are skilled hirelings, and a +1 bonus if any participant has the cartographer, loremonger, or hoards­person position. The number of successes is compared to the Headquarters Modification table.

Headquarters Modification

|Successes|Benefit|
|---|---|
|0|The modification fails, and the franchise incurs cost overruns of 1,000 gp per franchise rank.|
|1|The modification fails, and the franchise incurs cost overruns of 500 gp per franchise rank. However, the cause of the failure is apparent, granting advantage on any future checks to perform the same modification.|
|2|The modification succeeds but incurs a cost overrun of 100 gp per franchise rank. The modification also has a minor drawback, as determined by the DM.|
|3|The modification succeeds with no cost overruns or drawbacks.|

Complications. A result of 0 successes or 1 success automatically creates a complication. Other results might create a complication at the DM’s determination. The DM can select a complication or roll on the Headquarters Modification Complications table.

Headquarters Modification Complications

| d6  | Complication                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | An accident during the modification injures a franchise staff member. That NPC’s family demands compensation equal to 100 gp per franchise rank. It might be possible to instead appease the family by performing a service.                           |
| 2   | A spy makes a copy of the plans for the modification, learning its function and taking that information back to a rival organization.*                                                                                                                 |
| 3   | The modification was based on information originating with a rival. If the modification failed, the plans were intentionally faulty. If it succeeded, the characters detected the fault, but must decide how to respond to the attempted sabotage.*    |
| 4   | A local official insists that permits were needed for the modification, and demands payment or a favor to make the problem go away.*                                                                                                                   |
| 5   | The work causes the franchise headquarters to develop a quirk, such as strange noises, unwelcome smells, weird vibrations while mobile, and the like. Resolving the problem might require consulting a sage or an expert in headquarters construction. |
| 6   | The modification work uncovers a previously unknown problem with the headquarters, such as a structural defect, a dormant monster, bodies interred in the foundations, a concealed cursed item, and so forth.                                          |
## Marketeering
Every successful franchise knows that brands require constant management. Developing new markets, shaping catchy slogans, and surveying and engaging customers can all create new sources of revenue. Should you write and sell exciting chapbook serials based on the exploits of Omin, Jim, Môrgæn, and Viari? Should you sell a complex investment scheme to a city’s guild masters? Should you create a branded stage production based on your franchise’s exciting adventures, with a line of clothing to match? All those things and more are encompassed by the fine art of marketeering.

Resources. The players must first sketch out their marketeering plan and present it to the DM. A character or franchise staff member must spend at least one workweek to engage in marketeering, and must spend 100 gp per franchise rank in expenses. Spending more money increases the chance of the plan’s success.

Resolution. A marketeering effort requires three ability checks, representing drafting the campaign, launching the campaign, and managing its success. Any of the characters or staff members involved in the marketeering can make a check. The DM decides which abilities and skills are applicable, based on the marketeering plan. For example, a plan involving selling a new line of religious items might require an Intelligence ([Religion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to draft the idea and develop the products, a Charisma ([Deception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to convince local temples to promote the idea, and a Charisma ([Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to ensure the plan receives continued support.

Each check gains a +1 bonus for each additional 100 gp per franchise rank spent above the baseline expenses. When additional gold is spent, the character making the checks determines which checks the bonuses apply to. Additional gold can be spent at any point in the process, allowing the franchise to put more effort into subsequent checks if earlier checks are less than successful. If the character making the check has the obviator or secretarian position, they receive an additional +1 bonus to each check. A maximum bonus of +5 can be applied to each check.

The DC of each check is determined randomly, reflecting the always-unpredictable conditions of the market. The DM rolls 2d10 + 5 for the DC, generating a separate result for each check. The total number of successes determines the outcome of the activity, as noted on the Marketeering table.

Marketeering

|Successes|Benefit|
|---|---|
|0|The marketeering plan fails. The franchise’s monthly costs increase by 20 percent for 1 month.|
|1|The marketeering plan provides no improvements or setbacks.|
|2|The marketeering plan provides moderate benefits. The franchise’s monthly costs decrease by 25 percent for 1 month.|
|3|The marketeering plan is a complete success. The franchise’s monthly costs decrease by 25 percent for 2 months.|

Complications. A result of 0 successes or 1 success typically indicates that the marketeering plan incurs a complication. However, even a successful result can trigger a complication at the DM’s determination. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Marketeering Complications table.

Marketeering Complications

| d8  | Complication                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | The marketeering plan attracts the attention of Head Office, where someone absolutely hates it. A NPC is sent to oversee the franchise “for a while,” with an outcome determined by the DM.*                                    |
| 2   | Marketeering materials go missing right before launch, forcing the franchise to recreate them at the last minute. This might incur additional baseline costs or affect the reduction of franchise costs, as the DM determines.* |
| 3   | Just as the marketeering plan is released to the public, the characters realize that a competing group released a surprisingly similar plan just a tenday previous. Customers now think the franchise is copying its rival.*    |
| 4   | The marketeering’s message alienates or offends a crucial demographic. Protests spring up, and the affected group demands reparations.                                                                                          |
| 5   | A local official or noble begins to look into claims of deceptive advertising tactics or questionable hiring practices related to the marketeering plan.*                                                                       |
| 6   | The marketeering plan creates great interest — but unfortunately steers customers toward similar products or services offered by a competitor.*                                                                                 |
| 7   | The catchphrase or theme song of the marketeering campaign is a surprise hit, and everyone repeats it endlessly! Until they tire of it and begin blaming the franchise for mental trauma.                                       |
| 8   | The marketeering plan is undermined by rumors of a problem with the product or service, causing it to be dangerous to anyone using it.*                                                                                         |
## Philanthropic Enterprise
It can feel great to give to charity and help those in need. Pretending to care about others can also be a great way to earn favor with governments and nobility, gain tax write-offs, or win over customers. Head Office might suggest (or even require) that a franchise undertake this activity if it has recently gained negative publicity or been discovered to engage in shady activities.

Franchise members should select a philanthropic cause related to a nearby area, settlement, or group of people. Example causes include such efforts as picking up trash from roads or forests, improving schools, and raising funds for victims of a recent disaster. (That last one is an especially good idea if the disaster was caused by the franchise). Success benefits the franchise by helping the selected cause — or at least giving the appearance of having done so. Failure might worsen both the underlying issue and the franchise’s reputation.

Resources. The philanthropic exercise activity requires at least one workweek of effort, and incurs 50 gp per franchise rank in expenses.

Resolution. One character or staff member involved in the philanthropic enterprise makes an ability check determined by the DM. A Charisma check using the character’s choice of skill is often appropriate, but the DM might decide that a specific philanthropic approach requires a different ability and skill. A character with the documancer or occultant position gains a +1 bonus to the check. The total of the check determines the outcome, as shown on the Philanthropic Enterprise table.

Philanthropic Enterprise

|Check Total|Result|
|---|---|
|1–5|The philanthropic enterprise is a disaster. The cause is left severely worse off, and literally everyone blames the franchise.|
|6–10|The cause shows no real improvement, and people are slow to accept the franchise’s claims of wanting to help.|
|11–15|The franchise is praised for its help in improving the chosen cause. Donations to the cause pour in, allowing the franchise to skim an honorarium of 200 gp.|
|16–20|The cause shows serious improvement, and the franchise is heralded for its actions. Donations to the cause pour in, allowing the franchise to skim a management fee of 500 gp.|
|21+|The cause shows remarkable improvement, and the franchise is credited for all but fully resolving the issue. Local officials provide a tax break, reducing the franchise’s monthly costs by 20 percent for 2 months.|

Complications. A result of 1–5 on the Philanthropic Enterprise table automatically generates a complication. But the DM can decide that even success might have drawbacks, either choosing or rolling for a complication on the Philanthropic Enterprise Complications table.

| 1   | The selected cause is secretly the purview of a thieves’ guild or other criminal organization. The organization resents the franchise’s efforts and decides to undermine the characters’ future endeavors.*                                                                                                      |

| 3   | A group of individuals objects to the franchise’s efforts, believing that the problem underlying the selected cause is part of the natural order. The group actively tries to convince others of the terrible side effects (real or otherwise) of the franchise’s philanthropy.*                                 |
| 4   | Another philanthropic group is already involved in the franchise’s cause. That group tries to cast the franchise’s efforts as ineffective and insincere.*                                                                                                                                                        |
| 5   | Hearing of the franchise’s good works, people who are affected by some other issue requiring philanthropic assistance show up at franchise headquarters in huge numbers.                                                                                                                                         |
| 6   | Members of the franchise work with an established group to perform the philanthropic enterprise. But it soon becomes clear that the group is a sham — and that local officials are looking into their activities. The characters need to fix the situation, or risk being implicated in scandal by association.* |
## Running a Franchise
Running a business is one of the [downtime activities](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/between-adventures#DowntimeActivities "downtime activities") presented in the _[Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide")_, but an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is no mere business. This new downtime and franchise activity covers the many and varied duties necessary to keep a franchise running smoothly, and determines how well the characters and their staff manage those duties.

Resources. Unless the DM decides otherwise, this franchise task must be run at the end of each month of game time. Unlike other activities, results are determined for running a franchise even if specific characters and staff members are not allocated to the activity. However, allocating characters or staff members to running the franchise greatly improves the chances for a favorable outcome.

During any given month, the players decide how many days their characters and the franchise staff can dedicate to this activity. Characters and staff members cannot perform other activities while focused on this activity (as normal), and any days spent adventuring or engaged in other activities cannot be used for this activity.

Resolution. Percentile dice are rolled by a player nominated for this task by the group. The number of total days spent by all characters and staff members on this activity are added to the roll. That total is then compared to the Running a Franchise table to determine what happens for the month.

Running a Franchise

|d100 + Days|Result|
|---|---|
|01–10|The franchise has a ruinous month. Declining sales and rising expenditures increase the franchise’s monthly cost by 150 percent.|
|11–20|The franchise suffers severe setbacks. Monthly cost increases by 125 percent.|
|21–30|The franchise struggles. Monthly cost increases by 100 percent.|
|31–40|The franchise performs poorly. Monthly cost increases by 50 percent.|
|41–50|The franchise operates normally. Monthly cost does not change.|
|51–60|The franchise sees strong sales and trims expenses. Monthly cost decreases by 50 percent.|
|61–70|The franchise improves operations and sales. Monthly cost decreases by 100 percent.|
|71–80|The franchise has an excellent month. Monthly cost decreases by 110 percent.|
|81–90|The franchise has a fantastic month. Monthly cost decreases by 125 percent.|
|91+|The franchise is a shining example to other Acquisitions Incorporated franchises. Monthly cost decreases by 150 percent.|

Determining Monthly Cost. A franchise’s base monthly cost is a combination of the cost for the franchise’s headquarters and a multiplier for franchise rank. The fancier the headquarters, the more the upkeep. And the bigger the franchise, the more overhead it has. The “[Franchise Advancement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ai/growing-your-franchise#FranchiseAdvancement "Franchise Advancement")” section earlier in this chapter has more information on determining a franchise’s base monthly cost.

Whenever a downtime or franchise activity modifies a franchise’s costs for a given month, that increase or decrease is totaled up with all other increases and decreases. For example, a successful marketeering campaign might decrease the franchise’s monthly costs by 25 percent, but then a major threat as a result of exploring franchise territory increases monthly costs by 50 percent — a net increase of 25 percent.

Whenever the final result indicates that the franchise’s monthly costs have decreased 100 percent, profits and expenses exactly balance each other out, so that the franchise has no payment to make for that month. Whenever the final total is a decrease in monthly costs of more than 100 percent, this means the franchise has paid its expenses and earned a profit to boot. Calculate the profit based on the amount of the decrease above 100 percent. For example, a franchise whose monthly costs come out at a decrease of 150 percent earns a profit equal to 50 percent of the franchise’s base monthly cost.

Nonpayment Penalties. At the end of this activity, the franchise makes a payment to Head Office to cover its monthly costs. If it does not do so, the franchise begins to fail. See the rules for defaulting in the “Franchise Costs” section, earlier in this chapter. Regardless of what action Head Office takes, a franchise’s inability to pay its expenses should result in complications and story ramifications. Local folk and businesses start to demand that accounts be cleared. The general public might begin to reject the franchise’s products and services, worried about dealing with dodgy businesspeople.

Complications. A franchise automatically suffers a complication if the check for this activity was 30 or less. The DM might also impose a complication even when a franchise is doing well. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Running a Franchise Complications table.

| 1   | The franchise’s sales of products and services have attracted competition from a rival.*                                                                                                                                           |
| 2   | Regardless of its success month to month, the franchise’s long-term planning is called into question. Head Office demands that the characters engage in either the franchise restructuring activity or the team building activity. |
| 3   | A person who insists they are in no way from Head Office suggests that the franchise should run the shady business practice activity. It really feels more like a demand than a suggestion.                                        |
| 4   | Customers are turning away from the franchise. Until the characters can determine the cause, each subsequent check for the running a franchise activity takes a −5 penalty.*                                                       |
| 5   | A staff member finds signs of sabotage impacting the franchise’s operations.*                                                                                                                                                      |
| 6   | Staff members start demanding higher pay and threaten to go on strike.*                                                                                                                                                            |
## Scrutineering
As a member of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, you scoff at those who limit their intelligence-gathering activities to mere research or sagery. The scrutineering activity covers basic research easily enough (finding a new profitable venture, learning what pleases Head Office, amassing lore about a site or monster, and so forth). But it can also expand across a much broader range of activities. You might engage (“kidnap” is such a harsh word) members of a rival group, learn the secrets of a stronghold known only to those who built it, assess an organization’s business model to determine its weaknesses, or lay rightful claim to any information that might benefit your franchise in some way.

Resources. The DM determines what resources are required for any particular scrutineering goal, including access to specific people or places. Once that access has been gained, this activity requires at least one workweek of effort and 100 gp per franchise rank spent on bribes, materials, and other expenses. Spending more money increases the chance for successful scrutineering.

Resolution. The character or staff member overseeing the activity makes an Intelligence check, and can make use of a skill appropriate to the scrutineering activity at the DM’s discretion. This check gains a +1 bonus per 100 gp spent beyond the baseline expenses. A character with the documancer position gains a +1 bonus to the check. A maximum bonus of +10 can be applied to this check. The total of the check determines the outcome, as shown on the Scrutineering table.

Scrutineering

|Check Total|Outcome|
|---|---|
|1–5|No effect.|
|6–10|You learn one piece of lore.|
|11–20|You learn two pieces of lore.|
|21+|You learn three pieces of lore.|

Each piece of lore you uncover through scrutineering might cover specific details about a creature or NPC, how to thwart the defenses of a stronghold or office, the rituals or magic items employed by a mystical order, and so forth. The DM makes the final decision regarding what information is revealed by scrutineering.

Complications. Whenever this activity is undertaken, the DM determines whether a complication is warranted. Even if the information you uncover with scrutineering is accurate, additional things you didn’t learn might complicate your understanding. Your attempts to uncover secret information might also be thwarted by those intent on keeping those secrets. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Scrutineering Complications table.

## Shady Business Practice
The quickest path to success often runs straight through the thickets of questionable legality. Franchises that can overcome the morally dubious aspects of certain enterprises — and can deal with the risk of being caught engaging in those enterprises — might wish to consider such time-honored practices as back-of-the-wagon discount sales, fly-by-night gambling halls, highway robbery, racketeering, and pyramid schemes. Shady business practices can also include corporate espionage against rivals and other Acq Inc franchises, including stealing goods or sabotaging commercial efforts.

_A SUITABLY SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICE_

Resources. An intended shady business practice is detailed by the players and approved by the DM. Any shady business practice requires at least two workweeks of effort, plus 50 gp per franchise rank in expenses to set up the scheme.

Resolution. A shady business practice requires three ability checks, reflecting the ongoing progress of the chosen scheme. Any of the characters or staff members involved in the shady business practice can make a check. The abilities and skills applicable for each check are determined by the DM, reflecting the selected scheme and the ongoing narrative. For example, an attempt to set up a fly-by-night casino might require an Intelligence ([Investigation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to case a town for a suitable location, a Wisdom or Charisma check making use of gaming set proficiency to run the operation, and a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to get away with the profits. At the DM’s determination, each check gains a +1 bonus if the character making the check has a background appropriate to the shady activity.

The DC of each check is determined randomly, reflecting the risky nature of criminal enterprises. The DM rolls 2d10 + 5 for the DC, generating a separate result for each check. The total number of successes determines the outcome of the activity, as noted on the Shady Business Practice table.

Some outcomes of shady business provide an additional benefit, chosen by the DM and relating to the characters’ chosen enterprise. For example, a franchise engaged in corporate espionage might gain insight into a rival, while a franchise selling black-market goods might learn the name of a corrupt government official.

Shady Business Practice

|Successes|Benefit|
|---|---|
|0|All participants in the shady business practice are arrested, and the franchise is fined 250 gp per franchise rank.|
|1|The shady business practice is a borderline success, providing 50 gp in profits per franchise rank.|
|2|The shady business practice is a moderate success, providing 100 gp in profits per franchise rank. Additionally, the franchise gains a minor benefit related to the enterprise.|
|3|The shady business practice is a full success, providing 150 gp in profits per franchise rank. Additionally, the franchise gains a major benefit related to the enterprise.|

Complications. Achieving 0 successes automatically generates a complication, but the DM might decide that any illicit enterprise runs the risk of unforeseen circumstances. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Shady Business Practice Complications table.

| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | One of the franchise’s staff members is arrested in connection with the scheme — and is set to be interrogated about all the franchise’s activities.*                                                                                                                             |
| 2   | Characters or staff members meet a corrupt official or noble as a result of the scheme. This brash and flamboyant individual threatens to draw attention to any future shady enterprises.                                                                                         |
| 3   | A rival uncovers the shady scheme and threatens to expose it.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 4   | A citizens group hears rumors about the franchise’s involvement in the shady scheme, and forms a watch organization to monitor the characters.                                                                                                                                    |
| 5   | An NPC who participated in the scheme tries to blackmail the franchise, asking for payment or a favor to keep quiet.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 6   | A thieves’ guild or other criminal organization takes an interest in the scheme. They order the franchise to run this activity every month, and demand a 10 percent cut. While the franchise does so, all checks for shady business practice activities are made with advantage.* |
## Schmoozing
The schmoozing activity is more than just random carousing, chatting people up at society parties, or pumping strangers for information over copious drinks. (Full disclosure: copious drinks are often still a part of the bigger schmoozing picture.) For characters in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, schmoozing is a carefully focused engagement of bargaining and influence, designed to harvest contacts important to a franchise’s interests.

Resources. Schmoozing covers at least one workweek of interactions. Characters or staff members undertaking this activity must look and play the part of the confident franchisee — dressing well, spending money, giving gifts to new friends, and so forth. Schmoozing with laborers and other working-class folk might incur expenses of 10 gp per franchise rank, with expenses escalating to 100 gp or more per franchise rank for schmoozing professionals and business rivals. Schmoozing at the highest level with nobles or ranking members of a faction might incur expenses of 250 gp or more per franchise rank as the character or staff member attempts to put on an impressive social display.

Resolution. The character or staff member engaging in schmoozing determines whether they want to establish relations with specific NPCs or with any general representative of a group. The character makes a Charisma ([Persuasion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to determine the effectiveness of their schmoozing, as noted on the Schmoozing table. A character with the obviator position gains a +1 bonus to the check. A character with a background related to those they attempt to schmooze gains a +1 bonus to the check (a criminal schmoozing other criminals, a guild artisan schmoozing a guild master, and so forth).

Schmoozing

|Check Total|Result|
|---|---|
|1–5|The character’s failed schmoozing brings the franchise into disrepute. Any further checks made for the franchise to schmooze NPCs from the same group or organization are made with disadvantage.|
|6–10|The character becomes known to those they schmooze, but gains no immediate benefit. If the character undertakes this activity again within the same group or social circle, the next check to schmooze is made with advantage.|
|11–15|The character successfully establishes the desired contacts, and is treated as a confidante of those they schmoozed.|
|16–20|The character establishes the desired contacts and is treated as a trusted friend.|
|21+|The character establishes the desired contacts and gains a favor as a result of their schmoozing skill.|

If contacts are successfully made, the DM determines which NPCs the franchise is able to ingratiate itself with, how long those relationships last, and what kinds of benefits the franchise might gain. Some schmoozed NPCs might provide only a single minor benefit to the franchise before realizing the one-sided nature of the relationship. Others might hang around wanting to help the franchise for years — whether the characters want them to or not.

Complications. A check of 5 or lower made to schmooze automatically triggers a complication. Because the stakes of schmoozing are often high, the DM might decide to have any successful schmooze attempt come with a potential downside. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Schmoozing Complications table.

Schmoozing Complications

| d6  | Complication                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | A different group notices the character’s schmoozing attempts. Agents threaten to expose the franchise’s ulterior motives unless the characters perform a favor or pay a bribe.*                                      |
| 2   | To win over a potential contact, the schmoozing character or staff member swore to participate in an initiation ritual from the contact’s group … without first learning the nature of that ritual.                   |
| 3   | A contact becomes convinced that the schmoozing character or staff member intends to leave the franchise and join the contact’s organization. It’s clear that they’ll become hurt or angry when they learn the truth. |
| 4   | In the attempt to win over a contact, it was necessary to reveal one of the franchise’s secrets.*                                                                                                                     |
| 5   | The character or staff member regrets giving a contact a personal item, a drop of blood, or a lock of hair. It seemed like a great idea at the time.*                                                                 |
| 6   | Shortly after schmoozing, the character or staff member receives a love letter from a contact — whether that interest is reciprocated or not.*                                                                        |
## Team Building
The frenetic pace of adventuring and running a franchise sometimes covers up underlying issues. Has the party’s cleric accidentally started worshiping a dark god? Is the majordomo at odds with the occultant’s habit of displaying entrails in the great hall? Is the fighter questioning their life choices? The team building activity can help characters work through problems, settle differences, and adjust the work-life balance. In the end, everyone ends up with a healthier working relationship. Or at least that’s the plan.

At the DM’s determination, characters might be directed by Head Office to run this activity each time a new franchise rank is gained, or during times of exceptional chaos or uncertainty.

Resources. Team building requires the involvement of at least two characters, or a character and a staff member. Those individuals must dedicate at least one workweek to this activity, whose particulars are worked out by participating players and the DM. The team building exercise might be a trust-inspiring ropes course, an emotional “resolve your issues” workshop, a meeting with an NPC spiritual guide, or any other suitable endeavor. Setting up the exercise incurs expenses of from 50 gp to 250 gp per franchise rank, as determined by the DM.

Resolution. Each character or staff member participating in team building chooses another participant, then creates a negative story connection to a bond, ideal, or similar element of that participant’s backstory. The players come up with such connections for their own characters. The DM creates connections for franchise staff, either on their own or in consultation with the players. (Characters and staff members do not need to pair up. If everyone else in the franchise has a particular problem with one character, so be it.)

Each character and staff member then makes a Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check. With the DM’s approval, different ability checks and skills might be allowed if they relate to the specifics of the team building exercise. A participant has advantage on their check if the DM decides the story connection was particularly clever or well roleplayed. All checks gain a +1 bonus if one of the characters taking part in the activity is a decisionist.

Each check is compared to the Team Building table. The outcome of the check can help redefine the relationships between individual characters, and can establish the tone of roleplaying between characters and franchise staff. Some outcomes also involve a team building memory that provides a potent benefit (see below).

Team Building

|Check Total|Benefit|
|---|---|
|1–5|The participant uncovers deep-seated issues between themself and their chosen partner. If this is a character, they have disadvantage on ability checks made in the presence of the partner until the character undertakes this activity again. If this is a staff member, they are traumatized and leave the franchise unless the characters can convince them to stay.|
|6–10|The participant did not benefit from the team building exercise, but avoided serious trauma.|
|11–15|The participant was able to work through one or more issues. If this is a character, they have advantage on the next check they make during a franchise or downtime activity.|
|16–20|The participant sees themself and their connection to the other participant in a whole new way. If this is a character, they have advantage on the next check they make during a franchise or downtime activity, and they gain a team building memory (see below).|
|21+|The participant has had an awakening, gaining a deep sense of who they can become and their connection to their partner. The character has advantage on the next check they make during a franchise or downtime activity, and gains two team building memories.|

Team Building Memories. The most potent personal changes inspired by team building can last a lifetime. Or at least an encounter. A character who earns a team building memory gains an extraordinary ability that can be used once. As a bonus action, the character gains one effect of the [enhance ability](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2083-enhance-ability) spell for 10 minutes (no concentration required).

A character can retain team building memories only from the most recent instance of this activity. If a character has unused team building memories and undertakes this activity again, those memories are lost.

Complications. At the DM’s determination, every team building exercise has a chance of creating a complication as things get real, yo. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Team Building Complications table.

| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | The team building activity is revealed to actually be a death trap, an island of doom, or a similar challenge. The DM determines whether this was an honest mix-up, the act of a disgruntled staff member, or the actions of a rival.*                                           |
| 2   | Upon hearing what took place during the team building exercise, uninvolved staff members decide that the franchise is subjecting them to too much trauma. Some staff members might threaten to quit, or decide they want more benefits.                                          |
| 3   | It’s revealed that the team building exercise was set up by a rival as an opportunity to ambush the participants, or to attack the franchise headquarters while the characters were away.*                                                                                       |
| 4   | The participants learn way too much about each other. Each character participating in the activity must select a bond, ideal, or similar background aspect from their partner and come up with a story explaining how this becomes a conflict for them.                          |
| 5   | Staff members who did not participate in the team building exercise feel left out, and morale drops at the franchise. The characters must find a way to raise staff spirits that does not involve running this activity again.                                                   |
| 6   | A staff member involved in the activity is secretly a member of a rival organization, or has been duped into doing that organization’s bidding. During the team building exercise, the rival organization plans to steal franchise secrets or destroy the participants’ morale.* |
